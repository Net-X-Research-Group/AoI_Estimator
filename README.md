# AoI_Estimator
This is the open source simulation code for "Optimizing Age of Information without Knowing the Age of Information", INFOCOM 2025. 

The ArXiv version of the paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06688

The current version is only available for Matlab. I am working on updating the Matlab/python code and make the MMSE estimator a separate interface. I will upload it right here ASAP.
